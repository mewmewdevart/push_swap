## 💡 About the project
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, I will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting. <br>

## 📁 Structure/
* ```include/```  The header file of the pipex project.
* ```bin/```  Where the final executable binary file goes.
* ```libs/```  The libraries (my own libft function).
* ```objs/``` Keeps all the .o files produced throughout the compilation process.
* ```rscs/``` Just my notes and researches about the project.
* ```srcs/```  Where the artcode happens!<br>
